# Roadmap

## Active planning sources
- [docs/active_plans/OASA-Wide_Glyph-Bond_Awareness.md](docs/active_plans/OASA-Wide_Glyph-Bond_Awareness.md)
  glyph-bond alignment plan.
- [docs/TODO_CODE.md](docs/TODO_CODE.md) coding backlog.
- [docs/TODO_REPO.md](docs/TODO_REPO.md) repo and release backlog.

## Archived plans
- [docs/archive/HAWORTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_attempt2.md](docs/archive/HAWORTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_attempt2.md)
  Haworth schematic renderer (core phases 1-5c complete, SMILES phases deferred).
- [docs/archive/RENDER_BACKEND_UNIFICATION.md](docs/archive/RENDER_BACKEND_UNIFICATION.md)
  render ops unification plan.
- [docs/archive/ROUNDED_WEDGES_PLAN.md](docs/archive/ROUNDED_WEDGES_PLAN.md)
  rounded wedge geometry plan.

## Near-term focus
- Finish glyph-bond alignment work in
  [docs/active_plans/OASA-Wide_Glyph-Bond_Awareness.md](docs/active_plans/OASA-Wide_Glyph-Bond_Awareness.md).

## Future work
- **Hexagonal grid alignment**: OASA geometry module for hex grid snap and
  validation (`hex_grid.py`), plus BKChem visual dot overlay and interactive
  snap-to-grid. See related work section in
  [docs/TRANSFORMATION_OPERATIONS.md](docs/TRANSFORMATION_OPERATIONS.md).

## Known gaps
- Add dates and milestones once a release schedule is agreed.
