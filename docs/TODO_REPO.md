# Todo repo

- Consolidate duplicated backlog entries across `docs/TODO_CODE.md` and
  `docs/TODO_REPO.md` as priorities stabilize.
- Implement the PubChem lookup work in
  [docs/active_plans/PUBCHEM_API_PLAN.md](docs/active_plans/PUBCHEM_API_PLAN.md).
- Publish OASA to PyPI from the monorepo.
- Plan BKChem binary distribution (macOS dmg, Linux Flatpak, Windows installer).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (packaging metadata and version reporting).
- Mirror OASA modernization for BKChem (mypy configs and tests).
- Decide on BKChem mypy scope (baseline vs targeted) and add a BKChem mypy runner.
- Reconcile licensing guidance in [docs/REPO_STYLE.md](docs/REPO_STYLE.md) with
  GPLv2 repo policy.
- Document runtime dependencies consistently in
  [packages/bkchem-app/README.md](../packages/bkchem-app/README.md).
