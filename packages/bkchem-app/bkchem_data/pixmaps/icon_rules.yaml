# Per-icon recoloring rules for generate_theme_icons.py
#
# Icons not listed in overrides use global defaults.
#
# mode options:
#   ink_only  - (default) replace dark ink strokes/fills with theme foreground
#   none      - skip recoloring; use original SVG colors for all themes
#
# Thresholds control what counts as "dark ink":
#   luminance_threshold  - max luminance to treat as dark (0.0 to 1.0)
#   saturation_threshold - max saturation to treat as unsaturated (0.0 to 1.0)
#   Colors must be below BOTH thresholds to be recolored.

defaults:
  mode: ink_only
  luminance_threshold: 0.35
  saturation_threshold: 0.3

overrides: {}
  # example: icon with saturated dark outlines needs higher sat threshold
  # some_icon:
  #   saturation_threshold: 0.5
  # example: icon that should not be recolored at all
  # another_icon:
  #   mode: none
